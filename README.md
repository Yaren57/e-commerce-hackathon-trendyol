This repo builds a leakage-safe Learning-to-Rank pipeline for Trendyol fashion search: it auto-discovers train/test data under a configurable DATA_ROOT, engineers fast features with Polars (price/discount, session stats, time signals, user/content affinities, OOF CTRs), and trains a session-grouped CatBoostRanker (YetiRank) to re-order results by click/order likelihood. The end-to-end script runs feature building, cross-validated training, and inference, then writes a ready-to-submit CSV where each session_id is paired with space-separated content_id_hashed predictions sorted from most to least relevant. The design emphasizes “as-of” joins and out-of-fold priors to avoid look-ahead, runs comfortably on a single machine, and includes simple configuration knobs (target column, folds, output path) for quick experimentation.
